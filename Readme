Wireshark Analysis: Comparing Traffic on Port 80 vs. Port 443

Overview

This project involves analyzing network traffic on Port 80 (HTTP) vs. Port 443 (HTTPS) using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer. The goal is to observe the differences in data transmission security, packet structure, and potential vulnerabilities when using unencrypted vs. encrypted web communication.

Tools Used
- Wireshark – Packet capture and analysis
- Web Browser – To generate traffic for analysis
- Command Line (Optional) – curl or wget for controlled requests
